    <h2><i>Summary</i></h2>
    <p>Born in Ontario, raised British Columbia now living in Nova Scotia, I have always had a passion for computers and design. Starting my training as an graphic artist attending the Center for Arts and Technology and the Art Institute of Vancouver, I quickly realized that I was drawn to the technical side of design focused on programming, specifically web development. My passion ever since has been fusing my traditional art background with my passion and knowledge of computers to bring unique and refined user experiences.</p>
