    <p align="middle">
      Born in Ontario, raised British Columbia now living in Nova Scotia, I have
      always had a passion for computers and design. Starting my training as an
      graphic artist attending the Center for Arts and Technology and the Art
      Institute of Vancouver, I quickly realized that I was drawn to the
      technical side of design focused on programming, specifically web
      development. My passion ever since has been fusing my traditional art
      background with my passion and knowledge of computers to bring unique and
      refined user experiences.
